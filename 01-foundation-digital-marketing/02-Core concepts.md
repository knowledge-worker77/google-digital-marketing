## Creating value
Sixty percent of the total population has access to internet and more people are gaining access to the internet every day so each business big or small needs a strong online presence if they want people to buy their products or services.

If every single business is becoming an online business then how can you be sure that the customer recognizes your brand or even notices it? This is where digital marketing comes into play. You use marketing to create a value proposition for the user by aligning the features of your product or service with the needs of the user. If the proposition is right then the customer will be attracted to your product.

Digital marketing is only effective when you target the specific audience your product is designed for otherwise you'll end up wasting time and resources.

The content that companies post on their social media channels should also be crafted for the exact customer segment and make sure that it reaches the right audience. If you're planning an ad campaign focused on students then you need to make sure you're going to run ads on the platforms students use the most and the time they use it. These analysis will help you launch a successful campaign that will generate leads and create value for the business.

You must also keep in mind that the content that your company posts on social media or any of the ads that you run must be crafted in a way that everyone from all walks of life feel included and no group of people feels insecure when they see your ads. Your campaigns should be inclusive.

## The user's journey
To really make sure that customers notice your product and brand in a sea of thousands of competitors you'll need to cater your product or service towards the customers’ needs and pain points.

Pain points are the specific problems that users are facing and require a solution for it.  The business that wants to be the most successful should ask it's users about how can they help remove the pain point from the customer’s life and not mindlessly try to sell them their product if they don't want it.

Businesses that focus more on the customer's journey rather than their own goals are more likely to make more sales and profit. A customer's journey starts with the problem they have and then they start looking for a solution and if your product solves their problem they'll come across it surely if you've done your marketing right. 

The customer journey starts from learning about the product and making a purchase.
A typical user journey could be like if Sam wanted to buy a new computer and he went online and searched for the latest models and after searching for a while he found one that he really liked and ordered it. The product was delivered on time and the manual for his setting up his new computer was very well written and he got it working and started using it which made him have a positive review about the company. After a few weeks his computer starts having a problem and he contacts customer support and they fix his computer. Sam was so impressed by the customer service that he know buys almost all of his electronics from the same store and every time he completes a purchase he adds a new touch point in his journey.

Every single user will take a different approach every time throughout the user journey and it's not about how it goes but about how the customer interacts with your business during his journey and by knowing this you can make the experience for your customers and potential customers more friendlier and better for them which will then become success for your business.

## Funnel marketing
A sales funnel is the process of how a potential customer becomes a loyal and permanent customer. The funnel is wide from the top and then starts to narrow down towards the bottom.

The top is where the product starts to attract potential and returning customers that have used the product in the past or are looking to use it for the first time. Your job as a marketer is to safely guide them to the end where they become loyal customers of your brand because the curious nature of humans allows us to drop out of the funnel during any step of the process. 

There are multiple versions of the sales funnel but the most common one includes only four steps: awareness, consideration, conversion, and loyalty. 

The first step is the awareness step and here the potential customer knows or has heard about your product from a friend or an online ad. The first step is the widest and it attracts potential and targeted customers for whom the product is designed.

The second step is the consideration phase and this is where your targeted and potential customers starts to get more and more information about your product and starts comparing it with the competition.

The third step is conversion, this is when your targeted audience and potential customers make a purchase to become a customer of your business and to increase the value of conversions you should focus on providing a great experience and value to the customer.

The final step is also the most hardest one to complete because you'll have to put extra effort into making sure that the current customers becomes a loyal one and keeps purchasing from your business for years to come. 

Making a potential customer to a customer is a hard process but making sure that customer stays a loyal customer is even harder because you'll have to keep showing him why your brand is better than the competition.

## Attracting potential customers and making sales
The first step of the marketing funnel is the awareness stage where potential customers get to know and explore your offerings. But making sure that who discovers your product is also an important factor. The target audience is the group of people that your product is specially designed for.

You need to research and find more about your target audience before you can market your product to them. For example, if your product revolves around teenagers than you can focus on social platform that is mostly used by teens and young adults and do partnerships with teen influencers and brands.

The wider your funnel is going to be at the top the more people are going to be attracted towards your product. Once a customer gets aware of you product than you need to keep on reminding them about the positives of your product when they are in the consideration phase.

In the consideration phase your customer could be comparing or evaluating your product against your competitors and you need to make sure that they select yours. You can tell them the advantages that your product has, give them a discount or new user bonus to make them go from a potential customer to a customer.

To goal of the first two stages is to make sure people know about your product and then have the knowledge about the offerings of your product.

## Driving sales and building loyalty
The third and fourth step of the marketing funnel are the conversion and loyalty stages. If you're successful in the consideration phase and a potential customer starts considering your product, then you need to make them feel confident about choosing your product and build trust with them. 

If they decide to purchase your product they have now entered the conversion phase and now you need to make sure that they become a loyal customer and keep using your product and keep making purchases from you.

Your customers will only be loyal to your brand if they have a pleasant experience with anything that they want from you after the purchase. If they get a faulty product make sure to quickly send them a replacement and provide a compensation and an apology to them. If they have trouble using the product make sure that customer service is top-notch and they have multiple options to lodge a complaint and resolve it quickly. 

You can also offer them discounts and keep sending them little gifts every now and then to make sure they are aware of the great customer service your company provides. This will build trust and loyalty and your loyal customers will also do word of mouth marketing for you for free which can drive further sales.
