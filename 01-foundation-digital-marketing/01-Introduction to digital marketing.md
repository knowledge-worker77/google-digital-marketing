# Introduction to digital marketing and e-commerce
The first ever online purchase was made in the year 1994 when a made named Dan Kohn sold a CD for $12.48 using an online encrypted website that he made himself and since then electronic commerce or e-commerce has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry and has made selling and buying items online child's play.

Enterprises, small business, and even individuals use e-commerce to buy and sell the things that they want because e-commerce is much cheaper than a brick-and-mortar store and attracts a global audience rather than the people in your area.

In our modern times, every single person or brand can open an online store in just a few minutes and starts to sell his products. This led to an over saturated marketplace where people didn't know what to buy from whom. This crowded market led companies to bring their advertisements online as well and started marketing their products online.

Digital marketing is more than just ads, it helps to build customers trust and loyalty in the company and makes the company know more about the usersâ€™ needs so they can better fulfill them. Digital marketing is also a lot cheaper than other types of advertisements like TV ads or billboards. And, since people spend most of their times on their phones and computers digital marketing can attract a global audience.

Digital marketing allows ads to be tailored to specific customer segments. If your product is for students you can choose to target only people that are students and save your advertisement budget by a huge margin.

## Role of a marketing specialist
Digital marketing and e-commerce is a very big field and has many roles that you can play throughout your career. If you work in a small company or agency you'll have to do more than one task but at bigger companies your role could be quite small due to the amount of employees.

There are different roles that suit each and every individual in the digital marketing field like article writing, SEO, inventory management, customer relations, strategy analyst etc. etc..

An in-house role is one where you work with a company to promote their product and you can gain mastery in a specific skill set in these kinds of jobs. If you work for a marketing agency that has multiple clients than you will learn a much more broader set of skills and work with all different kinds of companies.

## Transferable skills
Digital marketing and e-commerce are fields where your previous skills and experience can be transferred to benefit you.

If your programming experience you can work more easily on SEO, If you're a data analyst you can easily create pricing strategies and conduct successful ad campaigns, and if you're from the IT field than you can help with automating the inventory system and simplify tasks.

## Types of marketing and e-commerce businesses
There are four main models of e-commerce that companies adopt and focus their products on, these include:
- Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce: This is the most common type of business model where companies sell their products to consumers. B2C businesses use social media marketing and hire popular influencers to market their product to consumers.
- Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce: In this model the consumer sells his products to another consumer. Platforms like Etsy, EBay, and OLX are major marketplaces for C2C businesses.
- Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce: Companies that adopt this model focus on other enterprise businesses and they need to make sure that their product is a perfect match for the customer because enterprise businesses buy in bulk and a single order can make or break things for your company.
- Consumer-to-business (C2B) e-commerce: This model is the opposite of B2C. In a C2B business the consumer sells his product or service to businesses that need his talents or products. Freelancing is a great example for this type of business model.
